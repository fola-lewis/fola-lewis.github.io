It’s actually a viral infection even though that’s what it’s called. It’s not the same as the hand, foot and mouth disease that animals get.

Spots, blistering, general redness and soreness are some of the symptoms my beauty girl Pumpkinella endured over the last week. Even inside her mouth on her tongue and her throat.

She had spots predominantly on her hands, face and bottom. The most annoying thing about the virus is knowing that I caused it by taking her to see a doctor after over a month of generally feeling unwell. I wanted them to check her over to be sure there wasn’t some other underlying cause why she had been unwell. And I honestly don’t know why I bothered because very rarely do we see a doctor who actually cares.

I will always follow my instincts as a mother so when I feel like my baby is unhappy and unwell I do everything in my power to help her to feel better. If I have to take her to the doctors every other day then I will. I’ve also learnt through some life-threatening events to trust my instincts and never just accept a response that doesn’t take into account my daughter’s symptoms, and which supports just waiting and seeing. It’s not that I wish to medicate, rather I want to understand and support my child as best I can.

For those of you who haven’t seen or experienced this virus, it’s apparently very common in children under the age of 10. It’s very easily caught through coughing, sneezing, and general contact with fluid from another person with the virus. I am 99% certain that the toy in the doctor’s surgery which my daughter played with was infected with this virus from another sick child. By the time the sores and spots really become visible, the child is already very contagious so it’s a tough one to prevent from being passed on.

Pumpkinella is rarely in contact with children other than her two cousins, something I do mean to turn around very soon, so I was confident the only place she could have come in contact with the virus was from the doctor’s surgery. She is also a finger-sucker therefore her fingers were a ripe breeding ground from playing with the supposed infected toys.

I do wonder whether the toys are sterilised or even cleaned each day in an environment that sees illness and infection passing through constantly.

I’ll be keeping this relatively brief as over the last 2 months I’ve struggled to finish any blog post I’ve started to write. Slowly, its become more and more difficult to write anything I’m proud of so today is my mini welcome back to my passion and favourite pastime.

For those reading this, please bear with me a while longer till I get back into the groove and my creative spirit is lit again.

Thanks for reading and see you soon!
