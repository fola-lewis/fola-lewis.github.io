Happy New Year! Welcome to 2016

I've been away over the festive period focusing on my family and trying desperately to unwind for the 9-5 grind. During the run up to christmas I wasn't feeling particularly festive. I'm a Christian but have not been going to church over the last year. Christmas to me has always been about my faith; celebrating new life and new hope. However, because I'm not actively participating in Church life, events like the annual nativity and outreach in the local community are not currently a part of my life. As such things felt quite hollow. <!--more-->

I chose to focus on my family, trying to iron out day-to-day life to the point where I'm able to enjoy time together with my daughter and get along with my husband.

I feel truly blessed and optimistic for 2016. I also feel quite nervous as there were so many disappointments in 2015 and I don't want to repeat any of them this year.

I'll keep this nice and short and say thank you so much for subscribing or visiting my blog over 2015. It's been an eventful year. Stay tuned next week for the start of my 30 day blogging challenge. The goal is to build on the foundation I started in mid 2015 when I made my blog public. Juggling a full-time job, a 2-year-old daughter, and all the other responsibilities that come with the grown up world, I'm hoping that this challenge will encourage me to find my writing voice and build something respectable and truly reflective of my personality.

See you again soon
