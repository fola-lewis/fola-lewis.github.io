        <title>Beauty Through My Daughter's Eyes</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/beauty-through-my-daughters-eyes-01.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Beauty Through My Daughter's Eyes&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last few months I’ve been hearing more and more friends and family members telling me I talk myself down too much. They say I’m too harsh about myself and am nothing like the person I seem to think I am. Sadly it was a critique about the things I say about myself and the alarming frequency I say them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t quite know when it started. I guess I wasn’t a pretty child and people made fun of me for being so dark. I also went through puberty at a really young age, way before sex education was taught and so I didn’t develop a particularly positive self-image, being different from all my friends and not understanding why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I say these things because I’ve noticed my daughter putting herself down lately. At 2.5 years old I’ve started to hear her say she’s not pretty and she’s not the cutey pie I’ve labelled her. The first time I heard her put herself down, it broke my heart. I tried to convince her she was every bit as perfect as I told her and believed she was. However she just got mad and defensive and shouted me down. Any further attempts to calm her down led to tears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where was this self-deprecating attitude coming from I wondered? But I needn’t have looked very far. I sat down after she’d gone to bed and began to wonder at what point my poor self image had started to rub off on her. To her entire family she is ‘The’ most perfect creature God has ever created. She has a kind heart, an infectious laugh and a beauty as unique and mesmerising as she is. I began to realise just how much of the world she sees through me; how her perceptions are being formed by the attitudes I display around her. We share this really special bond where I can tell what’s in her heart by just spending one on one time with her. When I’m unwell she’s subdued and reflective and when I am well she’s exciteable and adventurous. We have tge bond that is sometimes crippling where we can’t bear to be apart from one another for too long at any one time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She must see in me the fears and self doubts I harbour about myself. She must feel a similar sadness when around me while I’m putting myself down for being the wrong shape, not being worthy of good friendships and ultimately, the one I’m most embarrassed by, not being someone anyone could truly love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My daughter’s behaviour has alot to do with the way I behave around her and the realisation to me that she is growing up with my fears and anxieties is entirely unacceptable. I wish for so much more from her. I need her to grow up breakung any boundaries that stand in her way and truly being an important person for her generation. But in order for her to reach her potential, I must learn to love the person I am, the body I’m in, and the life I’ve ultimately chosen. Only once I can find a way to feel and behave more positively, will my daughter start to adjust her perceptions; seing and envracing her own beauty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I urge anyone that is in a similar position to me to really pay attention to the behaviour you are demonstrating when around your children and indeed even when you are in your own company. Your children are your mirror. They don’t lie or hold back their feelings like you do. They can see through your words, right to your emotions and your intent. They can see the sadness behind the smiles and the look of disbelief when your pay no attention to compliments and kind words from others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am now conscious that my behaviour is not bringing out the best in me and is certainly not demonstrating qualities I want my daughter to feel about herself or I. So day by day I challenge myself to fight through my feelings of fear and insecurity. Everyday provides a fresh challenge, call it an opportunity; unfortunately I fail on most days. But I continue to try, for the sake of myself and my daughter. In order to truly experience love, I must first learn to love myself. Once I can do that honestly, it will be apparent in my behaviour and it too will become infectious. My daughter will soak it all up like a sponge and grow to love and embrace her own unique  awesomeness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this encourages you to be kinder to yourselves and and love yourself like you want others to love you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>From Toddler To Mini Dictator</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/from-toddler-to-mini-dictator-01.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;From Toddler To Mini Dictator&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;its-begun--from-toddler-to-mini-dictator&quot;&gt;It’s begun – from toddler to mini dictator!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pumpkinella is now 2 years and 7 months old and has really come into her own. We can have sensible conversations where we’ll discuss the things she’d like to eat, what games she’d like to play and how her day has gone when I pick her up after returning from work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or fun things she’d like to do during the day. During these conversations I’m amazed at her rate of development. She’s already worked out sarcasm, to my detriment and often makes comments where I’m left wondering which adult she’s learnt them from. In truth I’m embarrassed to say she sounds just like me though so it just makes me laugh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having raved to others that Pumpkinella is such a sweet child and there’s no ‘terrible’ in her 2nd year of life; I’ve recently been sent crashing down to earth with a thud as my daughter has altered her behaviour to make sure she always gets what she wants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the things often shouted at me are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;‘I WANT IT NOW MUMMY!’&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;‘Go there, GO there…GO THERE MUMMY!’&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;‘I don’t want to eat my food, I WANT AN ICE CREAM CONE/ I WANT CHOCCIE BUTTONS!’&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;‘I DON’T LIKE IT THAT ONE!’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully you get the gist by now. Pumpkinella knows what she wants, wants it at a specific time of her choosing, and is not afraid to send it back if it isn’t the way she wants it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can just about cope with all of this, well only just! There are two things she’s just recently started doing that have resorted in my bringing out Jo Frost books of techniques for handling toddlers. One thing she has begun to do is to lash out when frustrated. I’ve been accidentally head butted, punched, slapped and kicked during her rare but lethal meltdowns. At first I was in shock and just went along with it to see if ignoring the behaviour would make her snap out of it. However, the behaviour tended to escalate to the point where I’d have to call in reinforcements in the form of Daddy (something I don’t like to do when I’m trying to be the boss-lady).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In comes Jo Frost to the rescue with the ‘naughty corner’ exercise. I can completely understand that it’s not for everyone as it’s very hard work and requires a lot of willpower from the parent(s). Also, Pumpkinella is  2 years old and some might argue that she’s too young to understand what she’s doing. My feeling is that when you have a child asking you if what she’s doing is naughty and then laughing in your face when you say yes, then continuing the behaviour, well you can tell at this point she understands right from wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before resorting to the daughter corner, I try and explain to Pumpkinella that her behaviour is not nice and makes mummy sad. I explain why it makes mummy sad and then tell her about the consequences of not changing her behaviour immediately. If she lashes out because she wants something then she will not get it until her behaviour changes. This works 80% of the time thankfully. She’ll agree with me that it’s not a nice thing that she’s either doing or has done. She will then go a little quiet and start another activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point of all of this is that I want to raise a happy and well-adjusted child with a passion for life and will change the world in her own special and awesome way. I dont want to raise a toddler who terrorizes others, lashes out or shouts at people to get her own way. Her mind is developing so quickly at the moment that I understand that much of the behaviour is her just trying to make sense of her environment. She is exercising her newfound independence and understand her boundaries. These will in turn help to further develop her personality and as such can’t really been seen as bad things. Instead, I choose to see this phase as the shaping and reasoning phase requiring guidance, support, and lots of hugs and kisses to help her transition to the other side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank God for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.netmums.com/&quot;&gt;Netmums&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mumsnet.com/&quot;&gt;Mumsnet&lt;/a&gt;, and other sites that have helped me to see that this is a perfectly normal and excitedly phase in Pumpkinella’s life. Finding the right tools to support her will make sure she flourishes and becomes the gamer-changer I’ve believe she will be.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>My In-Laws Are My Tribe</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/my-in-laws-are-my-tribe-01.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;My In-Laws Are My Tribe&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was touched by a story I read this evening about a mother without a village on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://mom.me/baby/31807-moms-without-village/&quot;&gt;mom.me&lt;/a&gt; website&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the things in this article resonate with me as a first time mum living in South Wales while my rather large family live in London. I don’t know what I was thinking when I moved away. No, actually I do know what I was thinking. I wanted to learn to look after myself. It felt the mature thing to do, to graduate from university, move out and get a job. Having tasted freedom for a short while during the university years, I was hungry for more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having met my now husband over 5 years on, I was elated to become a parent. But the responsibility and the isolation it came with was unexpected and unwelcome. Entertaining a baby who wanted to be carried and who either slept or cried was a reality I hadn’t been ready for. Without a close network of friends, I found myself alone, without any adult stimulation and my mind slowly turned into jelly with nothing more exciting to say at the end of each day other than to rave about my daughter’s poo’s and how easy or painful breastfeeding was throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I secretly felt that my husband was rather relieved to have a job to go to each day, to get a break away from the stress of being at home. He was very supportive but there were no breaks, no time-outs, not even private loo breaks. Pumpkinella could and would not be without me for any length of time, and I couldn’t bear to leave her to cry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In came the nurturing in-laws. ‘Have you had a bath today?’, ‘Have you eaten today’, ‘What have you had to drink over the last few hours?’. My responses were never very promising so like guardian angels, they flew in to the rescue, taking Pumpkinella from my arms and giving me the space to breathe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As someone normally quite hyperactive, full of life, and child-like, caring for a small child felt like a whole new ball game. I wondered where my friends were when I received no calls or text messages asking about our family’s well-being. It was during the days where I would have a migraine and my in-laws weren’t available that I came to the realisation that it really does take a village to raise a child. Having people you know who you trust not only with your emotions but that can help with the smallest day-to-day things; where were they?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I blamed myself for not being friendly and open enough to make strong enough connections with people who they cared about me even when they didn’t see me. I blamed myself again for being too so far away from my family that it wasn’t practical for them to come and visit regularly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, the thing is that we all need a village, and a tribe; people that can help to take the pressure off parenting. They can be shoulder to lean on, the reprieve after we’ve had no sleep for 3 days straight, and the voice of reason when we we’re too critical of ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see now why it’s so important to have a network of friends and family close by you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was given a spa day by my colleagues at work to enjoy just before giving birth or in the first months of being a new mum. However, I had no-one to go with and didn’t want to go with my husband as we had no-one to look after Pumpkinella during those early months. I leaned so much on my in-laws that I felt it was too much to ask of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The moral of this story? Reach out to people when you need them. Never take it for granted that they’ll be there when you need them. Take the time to build multiple support systems; friends you can be yourself with; friends that will wipe your tears on a low day but will equally celebrate the seemingly insignificant achievements like the baby’s first spoonful of yoghurt, just to make you happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, cherish and be gracious for the in-laws who would go to the moon and back for your child, their granddaughter. They love her nearly as much as you do and will be there if you need them. Ask for help, even if it’s just for some adult company and a cup of tea. Don’t expect that these people will know when you need them; but they will always come to the rescue if you ask them to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you Nanny and Tadcu Lewis – you are both awesomely outrageous and we love you to bits!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/my-in-laws-are-my-tribe-02.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Love is... Nanny!&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
